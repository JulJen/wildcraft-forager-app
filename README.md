# wildcraft-forager-app

Repository for my Flatiron Rails with jQuery Portfolio Project.

## Getting Started

This app uses the gem 'puma' in production mode. To use this app, clone this repository, run `bundle install --without production` to install the needed gems, and `rake db:migrate`.

To seed the database with test/example data, run `rake db:seed`.

Run `rails s`, and copy http://localhost:3000 to your browser to launch the site locally.

To use this app, first create your user account by signing up. End server with ctrl + c.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
